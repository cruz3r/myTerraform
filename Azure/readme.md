# Azure - Terraform
Trying to match up what is in the book from AWS to Azure.
With Azure to do the same tasks it takes more scripting.

- More resources are defined individually
- Finding examples for the same tasks are not as common
- I have found that reading things through have helped and now see different paths to accomplish things
